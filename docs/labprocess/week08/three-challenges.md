1. **Dynamic Pollution System**  
   **Description:**  
   One of the core mechanics of our game is the pollution system, which influences enemy strength, available resources, and environmental interactions. Pollution levels change dynamically based on player actions, such as destroying enemies, using specific weapons, or completing missions. This system requires real-time updates that affect gameplay elements without causing performance issues.  

   **Solution:**  
   To handle these real-time updates, we designed an optimized pollution tracking system that continuously monitors changes and recalculates environmental effects in a non-blocking manner. Pollution data is stored in a lightweight grid-based structure, allowing efficient access and modification. We also introduced threshold-based triggers that activate gameplay effects, such as enemy mutations or resource depletion, only when significant pollution changes occur.  

2. **Advanced Enemy AI**  
   **Description:**  
   Traditional roguelike games often rely on predictable enemy patterns, such as simple patrol routes or direct pursuit of players. Our goal is to develop enemies with adaptive behaviors that respond to player actions, increasing the challenge while maintaining fair gameplay.  

   **Solution:**  
   We implemented a behavior tree-based AI system, allowing enemies to switch between different states, such as patrolling, searching, attacking, and retreating. Enemies dynamically adjust their behaviors based on pollution levels, terrain conditions, and the player's combat tactics. Additionally, we incorporated group coordination mechanics, where enemies communicate and alter their strategies based on nearby threats.  

3. **Procedural Map Generation**  
   **Description:**  
   Since our game follows the roguelike tradition, we wanted each playthrough to feel unique, preventing players from memorizing optimal routes. Manually designing multiple maps would be time-consuming and lack scalability, so we opted for procedural generation.  

   **Solution:**  
   We designed a hybrid procedural generation system combining predefined map segments with randomly generated layouts. The game creates maps by stitching together pre-designed sections while adjusting enemy placements, obstacles, and resource locations based on pollution levels and difficulty settings. We also implemented a validation system to ensure maps remain traversable and balanced.
