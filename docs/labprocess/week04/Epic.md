## **Epic: Build a Replayable and Strategy-Rich Roguelike Core Loop**

### **Epic Description**

Create a roguelike core loop that players can enjoy again and again. Each playthrough offers different strategy choices, including random level generation, gear and skill combinations, progressive difficulty, and reward/punishment systems. The goal is to give players fun, challenge, and a sense of growth in the cycle of “start - explore - fight - die/win - restart”.

### **2. External Stakeholders**

- **Investors**  
  - **Focus:** Market potential and long-term profit.  
  - **Goal:** Make the roguelike loop a key feature to attract core players and grow by word of mouth.  
  - **Value:** Roguelike design increases play hours and repeat purchases (DLC, items), making it more commercially attractive.

- **Players**  
  - **Focus:** Is the game fun and deep? Is randomness fresh and exciting? Can failure still feel rewarding?  
  - **Goal:** Use strategy (gear, builds, terrain) to beat changing levels, and learn from failure for the next run.  
  - **Value:** Players always feel there’s something new, and improve with each playthrough.

- **Game Review & Approval**  
  - **Focus:** Follow content rules (violence, blood, etc.) and avoid gambling-like systems.  
  - **Goal:** Keep random mechanics within safe limits to pass approval, and adjust sensitive content as needed.  
  - **Value:** Smooth approval avoids delays or removal from stores and helps launch in more regions.

### **User Stories**

1. **bot1 – “Action Shooter Fan”**  
   As a fan of action shooters, I have a lot of time now, but most of them feel too repetitive. I want a game with more randomness.

2. **bot2 – “Roguelike Fan”**  
   As a roguelike fan, I’ve played many, but few games use battlefield changes as part of the strategy. I want that in a roguelike.

3. **bot3 – “New Player”**  
   As a beginner, I want to try roguelikes, but games like *Binding of Isaac* and *Slay the Spire* are too hard to get into. I want to adjust the difficulty myself to match my skill.

4. **bot4 – “Investor”**  
   We want the game to offer enough variety and long-term freshness to keep players.

5. **bot5 – “Game Reviewer”**  
   As a reviewer, I want the game to fit a wide audience, so I need it to avoid bloody or violent scenes.

6. **bot6 – “Colorblind Player”**  
   As a colorblind player, I often can’t tell items or characters apart in fast games. I hope the visuals use clear outlines and colors.

7. **bot7 – “Game Developer”**  
   As a developer, we want to raise environmental awareness. So we added a system where attacks harm the environment, making difficulty rise if it gets worse. Players must think about their actions.

- **Business Potential:** High replay value helps build a strong player base and supports DLC, seasons, or passes.  
- **Clear Team Roles:** Internal roles (managers, developers, designers) know their parts; external roles (investors, players, reviewers) also know what to expect and can give feedback.
